# ATmega32U4-UART

This project showcases a simple implementation using the ATmega32U4 microcontroller, specifically targeting the Arduino Pro Micro board, to control an LED connected to pin 0 on port D (corresponding to Arduino Pro Micro D3). Additionally, it demonstrates UART functionality.

The program toggles the LED once every second, sends a sequential character (starting from 'A' up to 'Z') through the UART, and then turns off the LED. This project is developed using Microchip Studio.

## Hardware Requirements
- ATmega32U4 microcontroller (utilizing the Arduino Pro Micro board)
- LED connected to Pin 0 on Port D (Arduino Pro Micro D3)
- UART interface

## Software Requirements
- Microchip Studio (formerly Atmel Studio)
- Appropriate drivers and libraries for ATmega32U4

## Implementation
The source code demonstrates a simple program written in C for the ATmega32U4 microcontroller. The code controls the LED connected to pin 0 on port D, allowing it to blink at 1-second intervals. Simultaneously, it employs UART communication to send sequential characters 'A' to 'Z' in a loop.

## Usage
1. Open the project in Microchip Studio.
2. Compile and build the project.
3. Upload the compiled code to the ATmega32U4 microcontroller.
4. Connect an external serial monitor to the UART interface to view the transmitted characters.
5. Observe the LED connected to pin 0 on port D (D3) blinking once per second while characters are sent through UART.

## File Structure
- `main.c`: Contains the main source code implementing LED control and UART transmission.
- Other necessary project files as generated by Microchip Studio.

Please refer to the code comments and the specific code in `main.c` for a more detailed understanding of the implementation.

This project serves as a basic example of using the ATmega32U4 microcontroller's UART capabilities along with controlling an LED, showcasing the integration of hardware and software to accomplish a simple task.
